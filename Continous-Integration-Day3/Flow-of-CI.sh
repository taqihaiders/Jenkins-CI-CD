#Continuous Integration Workflow Script
Below is a clear script-like representation of the Continuous Integration (CI) process. Each stage is explained step-by-step for clarity.

1. Code Commit and Transfer (Version Control)

Action: Developers make changes to the code and commit it to the Git repository.
Tools Used: Git Fetch, Git Push
Purpose: Ensures the latest code is stored and accessible in the version control system.
2. Build Process (Compilation and Packaging)

Action: The code is fetched from Git and passed to the build tool for compilation and packaging.
Tool Used: Maven
Purpose: Converts source code into a runnable format and packages it.
3. Unit Testing (Quality Assurance)

Action: Unit tests are executed to verify the correctness of individual code components.
Tool Used: Maven
Purpose: Detects bugs or issues early in the development cycle.
4. Code Analysis (Static Code Review)

Action: The code is analyzed for quality, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to standards.
Tool Used: SonarQube
Purpose: Ensures the code meets quality and security benchmarks.
5. Artifact Deployment (Storing Artifacts)

#Action: The final build artifacts (e.g., JAR or WAR files) are uploaded to a centralized repository for further use.
Tools Used: "Nexus or Sonatype"
"Purpose": Stores artifacts for deployment and sharing across environments.
"Key Notes":
"Stages": Each step represents a stage in the CI pipeline, executed sequentially.
"Automation": CI tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI automate these stages.
Feedback: Any failure in one stage halts the process, providing immediate feedback to developers.

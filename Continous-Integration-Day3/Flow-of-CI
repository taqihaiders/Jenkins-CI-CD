Flow of Continuous Integration

1-When developers make changes and commit the code, it is stored in Git. Tools like Git Fetch and Git Push are used to transfer the code.

2-The code is then transferred for the build process, which happens in Maven.
3-We then run unit tests on the code, which are also handled through Maven.

4-The code is then sent to SonarQube for analysis purposes.

5-Finally, the code is sent to Nexus or Sonatype for uploading artifacts to the server.
All these steps happen in stages.

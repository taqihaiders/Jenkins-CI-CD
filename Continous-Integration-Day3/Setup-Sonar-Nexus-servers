#Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus Setup
Jenkins Server:

1-The Jenkins server has already been set up.
2-There is no need to reconfigure Jenkins.

#Focus:

We will focus on setting up SonarQube and Nexus servers.
EC2 Instances:

1-SonarQube and Nexus will be deployed on separate t2.medium EC2 instances.
2-Source code will be uploaded to these servers for configuration.

#Security Groups:

1-Allow connections only from:
2-Your IP: For administrative access.
3-Jenkins server: For integration purposes.

Next Steps
Set up SonarQube Server:

Install SonarQube on the EC2 instance.
Configure the database and plugins for code quality analysis.
Set up Nexus Server:

Install Nexus on the EC2 instance.
Configure it to store and manage artifacts.
Pipeline as Code
Definition:

Started creating a Pipeline as Code to automate tasks such as:
Fetching code from the repository.
Performing unit tests.
Building the artifact.

#Script:

A script written in Groovy language will handle pipeline stages.
Key Steps in Writing the Script:

#Tools Identification:

1-Specify the tools required for the pipeline (e.g., Maven, SonarQube, Nexus).
Stages Definition:

#Define the following stages:

1-Fetch Code: Retrieve source code from the repository.
2-Unit Test: Run automated tests.
3-Build: Compile the source code and generate artifacts.

#Configuration:

1-Configure the pipeline to integrate with SonarQube and Nexus for:
2-Code quality checks.
3-Artifact uploads.
